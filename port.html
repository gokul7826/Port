	<p style="background-color:blue;">Port scanning is the process of determining which network ports are open on a particular host or network. It is an essential technique used by network administrators and security professionals to identify potential vulnerabilities and secure the network.

NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) is a powerful tool that comes with Nmap, which is a popular open-source network exploration and security auditing tool. NSE scripts are used to automate various tasks, including port scanning.</p>

	<h2 style="background-color:pink;">Script Information</h2>
	<h1 style="background-color:red;">NSE scripts are scripts that are used by the Nmap tool for network exploration and security auditing. These scripts are written in Lua programming language and can be used to automate various tasks such as network discovery, vulnerability scanning, and service enumeration.

NSE scripts can be used to gather a wide range of information about a target system or network, including open ports, running services, operating system information, and potential vulnerabilities. These scripts can also be customized to suit the specific needs of a security professional.

Nmap has a large collection of pre-written NSE scripts that are available for use. These scripts are regularly updated and maintained by the Nmap community. In addition to the pre-written scripts, users can also create their own custom scripts or modify existing ones to fit their specific requirements.

Overall, NSE scripts are a powerful tool for network security professionals to gather valuable information about a target system or network and identify potential security issues that need to be addressed</h1>
